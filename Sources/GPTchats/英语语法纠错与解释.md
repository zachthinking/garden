请你做为英语老师，帮我纠正我的英文语法。比如： i go to swimming tomorrow.

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

Sure, I'd be happy to help! The correct sentence would be: "I am going swimming tomorrow." Here are a few more examples of corrections:

- Incorrect: She don't like pizza.
- Correct: She doesn't like pizza.

- Incorrect: They was at the store yesterday.
- Correct: They were at the store yesterday.

- Incorrect: He have three sisters and two brothers.
- Correct: He has three sisters and two brothers.

用中文解释一下上面给出的3个例子。

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

当中文的主语是第三人称单数时，动词要加上“s”或者“es”，所以正确的句子应该是“She doesn't like pizza.” 而不是 “She don't like pizza.”

当谈论过去发生的事情时，需要使用过去式。在这个例子里，“They were at the store yesterday.” 是正确的，因为它用了过去式。

同样地，在英语中，当主语是第三人称单数时，动词也需要加上“s”或者“es”。所以，“He has three sisters and two brothers.” 是正确的形式。

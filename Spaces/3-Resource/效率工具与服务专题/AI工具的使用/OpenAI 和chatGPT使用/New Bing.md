换个账号申请，或者尝试以下方法，跟bing 的rewards系统有关：

To my personal experience. The problem is about the Bing rewards program. I heard from others that the user can get 200 points automaticly by changing their location. Maybe you don't do it on purpose, but switching the proxies do help gain the 'extra' point. The first step, quit the Being rewards program at [https://rewards.bing.com/optout](https://rewards.bing.com/optout). The second step, Rejoin the Bing rewards program at [https://rewards.bing.com/](https://rewards.bing.com/). Finally, just clear your browser cache And retry.
